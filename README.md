# 32-bit Single-Cycle MIPS Processor (Verilog)

This project implements a **32-bit single-cycle MIPS processor** in Verilog. The processor supports a subset of MIPS instructions and executes each instruction in a single clock cycle.

## âœ… Supported Instructions

The following MIPS instructions are supported:

- **Arithmetic & Logical**: `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `slt`
- **Memory Access**: `lw`, `sw`
- **Branch & Jump**: `beq`, `jal`, `j`

## ðŸ§ª Testbench

A comprehensive **testbench** is included to simulate and verify the functionality of the processor. It performs the following:

- Executes a set of sample MIPS instructions
- Checks correctness of:
  - Register updates
  - Memory read/write operations
  - Branching and jump instructions

## ðŸ“¸ Simulation Waveform

**Screenshots of simulation waveforms** are provided to demonstrate correct execution of instructions. These visualizations help:

- Understand how each instruction is processed cycle-by-cycle
- Verify internal signal changes and data flow
